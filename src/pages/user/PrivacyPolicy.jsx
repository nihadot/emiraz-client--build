                    12.1 IBA or Interest-based advertising are meant to deliver advertising material to users who show specific interest (target audience) while using our Services. It works by targeting users based on the type of content they access or read. For instance, as you browse our services page, the cookies placed on your device will be an advertising cookie so as to better understand the content you are interested in. This information collected from your device is grouped with information from other devices that show similar interests. This is then used to display advertisements to users grouped on the basis of common interests.
                    </p>
                    <p className="pb-2 font-medium text-[15px] poppins text-[#666666]">
                    12.2 You have the option to opt out of receiving Interest Based Advertisements though it does not mean that you will no longer receive advertisements when you are using our services. It would imply that the information collected will not pertain to IBA and that any advertisements you see will not be customized or be relevant to you. You can choose your online advertisement choices from http://optout.aboutads.info or by clicking the AdChoices icon in an ad and go by the instructions. Similarly you may also opt out of receiving interest-based ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's (NAI) Opt Out Tool (http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) It would be advisable to delete cookies, using a different device.

                    12.3 Mobile devices are provided with identifiers that help track the target users to serve ads in the target category to specific mobile devices. You can disable the mobile device ad tracking or can reset the identifiers at any time within your mobile device privacy settings. One other way to control ad sense on mobile devices is the AppChoices App: http://youradchoices.com/appchoices. You can also turn off location tracking on your mobile device. If these settings are disabled, the information collected from your device’s advertising identifier will not be used for tracking ad sense. After this the number of ads you may see will still be the same but they may be less relevant as they will not be based on your interests.
